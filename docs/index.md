      <p>My feature is about an SDK that will help to translate a .md file to the popular .docx format. This has been mostly achieved with the help of the popular package "Markdig" which helps to translate markdown to html and the "HtmlToDocx" package that is in charge of translate the new html file to the final result in docx format.
      Now, sounds like everything is done, but the complex part here is return to .md format from a .docx file, and that's what I'm working on and why I needed to learn the use of the OpenXML SDK.</p>
