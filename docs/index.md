    <h1>Widgets for the markdown to pdf</h1>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    <p>This project has the function to convert a markdown file into a PDF, for that, the markdown file is converted to HTML and the new HTML must be converted to PDF (this process is what I'm working on). In this project, I have the task of transforming the HTML into a PDF file, the challenge here is that there is not exist a package that converts automatically the HTML to pdf (as the markdown to HTML) so I need to create a new code to make that the PDF show correctly all the information with the correct format and functions, to make this I need to use Dart, and different packages.</p>

    <h1>Creating my first website with Vitepress</h1>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    <p>I am using Vitepress to specifically work on creating a website, with only Vitepress I have the chance to create and design a functional site, in my case, a blog site in wich the developers can upload their own blogs with information about on what are they working, how they solve a problem or any other idea o documentation.</p>

    <h1>Understanding OpenXML SDK</h1>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <p>My feature is about an SDK that will help to translate a .md file to the popular .docx format. This has been mostly achieved with the help of the popular package "Markdig" which helps to translate markdown to html and the "HtmlToDocx" package that is in charge of translate the new html file to the final result in docx format.
    Now, sounds like everything is done, but the complex part here is return to .md format from a .docx file, and that's what I'm working on and why I needed to learn the use of the OpenXML SDK.</p>
